### 🧪 Dataset Information

- **Name**: AirQuality 2.csv  
- **Description**: The dataset contains measurements of various air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, O3) along with corresponding health-related metrics.
- **Source**: *[Include the original source of the dataset here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository]*

---

### 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw air quality data.
- Visualize pollution trends across locations and time.
- Correlate pollution levels with health-related variables.
- Extract insights using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### 📈 Key Visualizations

> *(Add output images or graphs here from the notebook, for example):*

![Sample PM2.5 Trend](images/pm25_trend.png)
*PM2.5 concentration over time*

---

### 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Converted date formats and standardized units.
- Treated outliers using domain knowledge and statistical thresholds.

---

### 🧠 Insights & Findings

- A strong correlation between PM2.5 levels and increased respiratory cases.
- Air quality deteriorates significantly during winter months in urban areas.
- Suggests targeted policy changes for industrial zones.
